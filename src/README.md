# Paprika 3 Source Code

This directory contains Python implementations related to the Paprika 3 authentication and cryptographic systems.

## Files

- `demo_crypto.py` - Demonstration of the encryption/decryption process as described in crypto.md
- `paprika_auth.py` - Complete authentication implementation
- `decrypt_license.py` - Standalone license decryption script
- `auth_example.py` - Example usage of the authentication module
- Other utility scripts for analysis and debugging

## Usage

To run the cryptographic demonstration:

```bash
python3 demo_crypto.py
```

This will show the complete encryption and decryption process using the same algorithms and parameters described in the documentation.
